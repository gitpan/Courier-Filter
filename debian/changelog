courier-filter-perl (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Courier::Filter is primarily a plug-in for the Courier MTA, not a library
    of Perl modules intended to be used by other programs or modules.
    - Renamed package to "courier-filter-perl".
    - Install included Perl modules in the private path
      /usr/share/courier-filter-perl/perl5 instead of the standard path
      /usr/share/perl5.
  * Added liberror-perl dependency.
  * Made Build-Depends dependencies into Build-Depends-Indep (architecture
    independent) dependencies.
  * Various minor fixes.

libcourier-filter-perl (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian release.
  * Deprecated the MIMEParts filter module in favor of the new Parts filter
    module, which is compatible but a lot more powerful:
    - Switched from completely-in-memory processing to using temporary files
      in order to work around two nasty bugs in MIME::Parser and
      Archive::Zip.
    - Renamed the "max_size" constructor option to "max_message_size".
      "max_size" is deprecated but still supported for now.
    - The "max_size" constructor option now defaults to 1024**2 (1MB) instead
      of undef.
    - Added the "max_part_size" constructor option.
    - Added "views" support (as constructor option and signature aspect),
      supporting "raw" and "zip" views for now.
    - Added the "encrypted" signature aspect.
  * Added Envelope filter module.
  * Added etc/pureperlfilter.conf as a default configuration file.
  * Fixed the mysterious ``Can't call method "close" on an undefined value at
    Filter.pm line 299´´ bug that caused Courier::Filter to fail starting up
    on some platforms.  (File descriptor 3 must be opened in write mode, not
    in read mode!)
  * Fixed filter module group handling:
    - Skip the rest of the current module group and treat it as an implicit
      accept if a module in the group states an explicit accept.
    - Log rejections just once, right after a module has stated a reject, i.e.
      avoid logging the rejection for all higher recursion levels of the
      module group structure that contains the rejecting module.
    - Don't try extracting a logger from filter module groups, only from
      atomic filter modules.
  * Fixed the Header filter module:
    - Fixed handling of undefined header fields.
    - Prepend a "Header:" keyword to positive match results.
  * Disabled timestamping for the Syslog logger module, as syslog does its own
    timestamping.
  * Reworked configuration file example.
  * Refined Build.PL script.
  * Lots of minor documentation fixes.

libcourier-filter-perl (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * chmod the courierfilter socket to 0660, so the Courier daemon system group
    has write access to the socket.  This solves the "sendmail: Unable to
    submit message" permissions problem that occurred on some platforms.
  * Make Module::Build automatically create a Makefile.PL to facilitate
    auto-installation through the CPAN interface.
