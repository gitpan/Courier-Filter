# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   x = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)

--- 0.14 (2004-10-22 00:10)

  + Added documentation for the test-filter-module and pureperlfilter
    executables.
  * test-filter-module:
    * Fixed the command-line parsing and handling of control file names.
    * Made the result output format compatible with multi-line results.

--- 0.13 (2004-10-04 23:00)

  + Added Debian package control files.

  x Deprecated the MIMEParts filter module in favor of the new Parts filter
    module, which is compatible but a lot more powerful:
    x Switched from completely-in-memory processing to using temporary files in
      order to work around two nasty bugs in MIME::Parser and Archive::Zip.
    x Renamed the "max_size" constructor option to "max_message_size".
      "max_size" is deprecated but still supported for now.
    x The "max_size" constructor option now defaults to 1024**2 (1MB) instead
      of undef.
    + Added the "max_part_size" constructor option.
    + Added "views" support (as constructor option and signature aspect),
      supporting "raw" and "zip" views for now.
    + Added the "encrypted" signature aspect.

  + Added Envelope filter module.
  + Added etc/pureperlfilter.conf as a default configuration file.

  * Fixed the mysterious ``Can't call method "close" on an undefined value at
    Filter.pm line 299´´ bug that caused Courier::Filter to fail starting up on
    some platforms.  (File descriptor 3 must be opened in write mode, not in
    read mode!)
  * Fixed filter module group handling:
    * Skip the rest of the current module group and treat it as an implicit
      accept if a module in the group states an explicit accept.
    * Log rejections just once, right after a module has stated a reject,
      i.e. avoid logging the rejection for all higher recursion levels of the
      module group structure that contains the rejecting module.
    * Don't try extracting a logger from filter module groups, only from atomic
      filter modules.
  * Fixed the Header filter module:
    * Fixed handling of undefined header fields.
    * Prepend a "Header:" keyword to positive match results.
  * Disabled timestamping for the Syslog logger module, as syslog does its own
    timestamping.
  * Reworked configuration file example.
  * Refined Build.PL script.
  * Lots of minor documentation fixes.

--- 0.12 (2004-02-25 01:00)

  * chmod the courierfilter socket to 0660, so the Courier daemon system group
    has write access to the socket.  This solves the "sendmail: Unable to
    submit message" permissions problem that occurred on some platforms..
  * Make Module::Build automatically create a Makefile.PL to facilitate
    auto-installation through the CPAN interface..

--- 0.11 (2004-02-22 22:00)

  * Do not use the proprietary "boolean" pragma module, declare our own boolean
    constants instead.
  * Lots of minor documentation fixes.

--- 0.1 (initial release) (2004-02-16 23:00)
