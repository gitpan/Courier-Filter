# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   x = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)

--- 0.12 (2004-02-25 01:00)

  * chmod the courierfilter socket to 0660, so the Courier daemon system group
    has write access to the socket.  This solves the "sendmail: Unable to
    submit message" permissions problem.
  * Make Module::Build automatically create a Makefile.PL to facilitate
    auto-installation from the CPAN shell.

--- 0.11 (2004-02-22 22:00)

  * Do not use the proprietary "boolean" pragma module, declare our own boolean
    constants instead.
  * Lots of minor documentation fixes.

--- 0.1 (initial release) (2004-02-16 23:00)
